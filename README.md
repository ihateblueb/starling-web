# Starling
Starling is the next generation of moderation. Using Starling, it takes only a few seconds to combat trolls and rulebreakers on it's web app. 
It's currently still in development, but here's the plan: 

1. Install to server
2. Get token from server
3. Admin signs up with token, creates moderator accounts
4. Admins config the runnable commands
5. Moderators can login and use the app
