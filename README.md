# Starling Web
Starling is the next generation of moderation. Using Starling, it takes only a few seconds to combat trolls and rulebreakers on it's web app. 
It's currently still in development, but here's how it'd be used once completed: 

1. Install to server
2. Get token from server
3. Admin signs up with token, creates moderator accounts
4. Admins config the runnable commands
5. Moderators can login and use the app

## A Note On Selfhosting
You probably can, but I can't help you. Good luck!

## Contribution
If you'd like to contribute, thanks! Starling needs help with development. Here's some things to keep in mind:
- Avoid super formal language when writing visible text
- Always make CSS classes only lowercase for the first word (ex. `footerContainer` or `firstSecondThird`)
- Always make components all capitalized (ex. `Header.vue`, or `AutofillPlayer.vue`)
- Always try to make Starling accessible.
If you have suggestions but don't know how to contribute/don't want to, you can make an issue with the feature request (for creating new features) or enhancement (for building upon existing features) tags, pr by making a post in the Orchid Development discord server's Starling channels.

## Project ETA?
it'll be done in 2026 or something, idk. im not the absolute best at this, sorry !
